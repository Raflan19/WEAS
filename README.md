## Description

Wearable Emergency Alert System(WEAS) is an IoT-based project which sends real-time alerts(video, audio & location) to an android app when a button is triggered by a user in emergency like women, children, elderly people, etc. These alerts can then be viewed by trusted contacts, who can plan immediate assistance and also act as valuable evidence.
